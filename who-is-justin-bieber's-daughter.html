            <p> Justin Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, in London, Ontario, Canada. His parents are both of mixed African-Canadian descent. When he was two years old, his parents legally adopted him, and he grew up in a Christian household with six siblings. He began his music career in 2007 with a YouTube cover of Michel TelÃ³âs âFelixâ that attracted the attention of record label executives. He later signed a recording contract with record label, Universal Music Canada. His first single, âOne Time,â went number one in Canada, and his single âBabyâ reached number one in eight countries, making him the first artist to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with a song entirely in English.</p><h3>On March 1200an anonymous woman filed a paternity suit against Justin Bieber in Florida, alleging she gave birth to the pop starâs child in 2006.</h3><p> The paternity test results came back as inconclusive, meaning itâs possible Bieber is not the father. However, the results do suggest that Bieber and the woman had sex at some point in 2006, which means Bieber could be her biological father.</p><h3>The womanâs name was withheld to protect the identity of her child, who she claimed was conceived during a vacation she had with Bieber.</h3><p> The woman told the magazine that she and Bieber had sex multiple times at his California home when she was there for a week in December. She said she became pregnant after they had sex in Bieber's bed and that she had told him she was expecting his child.</p><h3>But a judge ruled the suit could not go forward because the woman had failed to produce a birth certificate or a court-ordered paternity test.</h3><p> The paternity test was ordered as part of the womanâs lawsuit against Bieber. The woman claims that she had sex with Bieber at a party in December 2012. She has stated that she had sex with the teen star for about two weeks before she became pregnant.</p><h3>In 201the woman filed a second suit against Bieber, this time identifying herself as Maria Del Carmen Teresa.</h3><p> The woman who filed the paternity suit against Bieber is Maria Del Carmen Teresa, a Colombian woman who is a former model. Bieber and Maria were in a relationship while he was living in Florida but broke up when he returned to California. In the course of the relationship, the two had a daughter together. Maria later filed a paternity claim, which was accepted by the courts.</p><h3>The woman claimed sheâd given birth to Bieberâs child in 200the same year sheâd met him.</h3><p> In December 2018, a woman named Melissa Selig claims that she had sex with Bieber in his California home in 2009, when she was just 17. Selig shared a photo of herself standing beside Bieber, wearing a shirt with the logo of the California high school where she was a student at the time. She also shared a selfie of herself with Bieber and her friends.</p><h3>Del Carmen Teresa filed the suit in California, where she resided.</h3><p> The singer is an American popstar who was born in Ontario, Canada. He began his career as a child and first became famous after uploading videos of himself singing on YouTube when he was just 12 years old. He eventually signed a recording contract with the record label, Schoolboy Records. Bieber is one of the most influential artists in the world and has a large fanbase in the United States and around the world.</p><h3>The judge ruled that the woman had failed to prove she was the biological mother of Bieberâs child.</h3><p> While Bieber has never publicly stated who the mother of his child is, the Biebers have been photographed with a woman who has been identified as the childâs biological mother. However, she has not been officially named the babyâs mother. The woman has not made any official statements about the child either.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> The Biebs has been linked to a number of women over the years, but there have been no rumors of paternityâuntil very recently. In January 2020, a photo of Biebs and his rumored girlfriend, 22-year-old model, Selena Gomez, surfaced on social media. According to People, Gomez was vacationing with Bieber in Havana, Cuba when the duo snapped a couple of photos together. Later on, Gomez posted a photo on Instagram of them cuddling and writing, âI love you â¤ï¸.â</p>
