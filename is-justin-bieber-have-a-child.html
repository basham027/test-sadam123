            <p> If you are wondering whether Justin Bieber has a child, there are no reliable sources to confirm or deny this. Although there are no concrete signs that Justin Bieber has a child, there are several reasons why we believe he could be a father.</p><h3>Since Bieber and Selena Gomez made it official way back in 201there have been a ton of rumors and speculation about the pop starâs love life.</h3><p> The Biebsâ relationship with Selena has definitely been going on for a while, and some might say theyâve already been together for a while â Bieber actually proposed to Gomez on the reality TV show âThe Hills.â However, the Biebs hasnât been able to put the rumors of a child with his pop star girlfriend to rest. The Inquisitr reported that Bieber has been spotted with a woman who looked pregnant in recent photos. The woman has also been seen accompanying Bieber to several of his concerts.</p><h3>Their relationship has been a hot topic since they started dating, and it seems like the speculation will never end.</h3><p> This is one of the biggest questions that fans of the Biebs have been asking since he began dating Selena. Justin Bieber has yet to confirm or deny whether he has a child with Selena Gomez, but the two have been spotted together more and more lately, and it seems like theyâre ready to make things official.</p><h3>Bieber and Gomez have been rumored to be dating since they were teens, so that definitely counts as a long time.</h3><p> The Biebs hasnât been able to have children yet with Selena Gomez, but that hasnât stopped the rumors of them having a child together. Gomez recently spoke about whether she would be open to having a relationship with Bieber again in the future.</p><h3>The two were first rumored to have started dating when they were 1when a photo surfaced of the two cuddling up on a couch.</h3><p> The Biebs and Selena Gomez were first rumored to have gotten together when they were just 1 year old in a photo that surfaced on the internet. Both of them were wearing matching outfits and cuddling up on the couch, and many fans suspected that they might be a family. However, the Biebs has never publicly acknowledged having a child with Selena Gomez.</p><h3>But the rumor was debunked when Elle magazine even joked, âJustin Bieber and Selena Gomez are just friends.â</h3><p> Justin Bieber is still young and single. Well, single and childless. But he doesnât seem to be in a hurry to settle down. He has been linked with Selena Gomez and other famous celebrities. He also has a lot of flings with girls on the internet.</p><h3>The two were rumored to be dating again when they were rumored to be leaving the country together to elope.</h3><p> We all remember when Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were rumored to be expecting a child, but after Selena denied it several times, it was revealed that she had actually miscarried. But could there be a child of Bieberâs in the works? The rumor has persisted ever since the two were spotted together in Brazil, and the Biebs has yet to make a statement about the matter.</p><h3>But it seems that the two are too busy making music together to even think about marriage.</h3><p> If youâre a Bieber fan, youâve probably spent time Googling to see if the Biebs has a child. If youâre wondering if he has a child with Selena Gomez, the answer is no. The two have never been married and Bieber has never even proposed to Gomez. Thereâs no evidence that Justin Bieber has a child.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> If Justin Bieber is single, he is yet to have a child. He has been linked to a number of women and even proposed to several of them, however, none of them have given birth to a child so far. There are no reports of Justin Bieber having a child with any woman that he has been linked to.</p>
