            <p> The Biebs was born on February 11, 1994, which means he was 20 years old when this year began. Itâs safe to say that most 20-year-olds have already begun their adult lives. But Bieber is still very much a teenager. He just turned 22 last month. Heâs still a teenager in the eyes of the law, which means heâs still under the jurisdiction of his parents. Bieber is only legally an adult in California, Texas, Florida, and Georgia.</p><h3>Justin Bieber was born on March 1994.</h3><p> Born on March 1, 1994, Justin Bieber was 11 years old when the music video for his hit single âBabyâ was released. This was the first music video he ever starred in, and it blew up the charts so quickly that Justin was soon a household name.</p><h3>He was exactly years old when he was arrested for driving under the influence in Florida.</h3><p> At the time of his DUI arrest, Bieber was 22 years old. His birthday is March 1st, 1994, so he was just 20 years old.</p><h3>He was when he appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show for the first time.</h3><p> At the time of his appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres show, the Biebs was 11 years old. A lot of people thought that he looked older than he was, which is pretty ironic since heâs still just a kid!</p><h3>He was when he released his first album, My World.</h3><p> Just before his first birthday, Justin Bieber was already attracting plenty of attention. Not only did he sing for the first time in public in December of 2009, but he was also seen dancing and crawling into the crowd. Of course, most parents probably werenât too thrilled about their little boy being able to move around so freely.</p><h3>He was when he made his first appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was his first appearance on a live national TV show.</h3><p> He was born on February 11, 2002, in Ontario, Canada, making him a teenager when he first appeared on Saturday Night Live.</p><h3>He was when he released his second album, My World 2.</h3><p> At the time of the album's release, Bieber was 11 years old. That means he celebrated his 12th birthday in May. Now, 12 is an important age because it's when a child begins to think more about themselves, form opinions, and express their feelings.</p><h3>He was when he released his third album, Changes.</h3><p> There is no way around it, Justin Bieber is only 17 years old. While thatâs not an incredibly young age for a teen to drop an album, Bieberâs been a pop star for a long time. He debuted as a YouTube sensation when he was 11 years old, and since then, heâs put out three albums, including his most recent which dropped in May.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> While fans of Justin Bieber have known for some time that the young starlet was born on March 1, 1992, the singer himself has not yet given an official answer to this and other questions on the matter. However, Bieber has made several comments about his age on Twitter, and some of them suggest that he is around 22 years old.</p>
